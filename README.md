Type: Android Mobile Application

Language Used: Java, PHP
IDE: Android Studio
Database: Mysql
API Used: Mapbox, Google Maps

This project is based on Car Sharing from one place to the another.
Mapbox is used for maps. 

Firstly the user is directed to the Login and Registration Page. After registering one can login and they are taken to their profile. 
For this I have used Java for validation. Mysql local server is used for storing data where php validates the registration data.

User are picked up from their current postion and dropped off to their desired destination and this application keeps track 
of the distance from pick up to drop off.
